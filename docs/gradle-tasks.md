# Gradle Tasks

A list of commonly used Gradle commands in the project, with brief explanations of what each task does.

---

## Clean

'./gradlew clean'
> Deletes the module's 'build/' directory, removing all files generated by previous builds.

---

## Lint & Static Analysis

'./gradlew lint'
> Runs static analysis on the Android code to detect style violations, potential bugs, and best practices.

'./gradlew lintFix'
> Attempts to automatically fix issues detected by the Android lint tool.

'./gradlew detekt'
> Runs static analysis on Kotlin main source code to detect design, style, and quality issues.

'./gradlew detektCoreDebugUnitTest'
> Analyzes the Kotlin code in local JVM test sources (unit tests in debug mode).

'./gradlew detektCoreDebugAndroidTest'
> Analyzes the Kotlin code in instrumented Android test sources (debug mode).

---

## Build

'./gradlew assembleDebug'
> Builds the debug APK or app bundle without running tests. Useful for development and debugging.

'./gradlew assembleRelease'
> Builds the release APK or app bundle, optimized and signed for production distribution.

---

## Testing

'./gradlew connectedCoreDebugAndroidTest'
> Runs Android instrumented tests ('androidTest') on a connected device or emulator (debug mode).

'./gradlew testCoreDebugUnitTest'
> Runs local JVM unit tests in debug mode.

---

## Code Coverage

'./gradlew jacocoCoverage'
> Generates a code coverage report for local JVM tests using JaCoCo.  
> ⚠️ Requires 'testCoreDebugUnitTest' to be run beforehand.

'./gradlew createDebugCoverageReport'
> Runs instrumented tests and generates a JaCoCo coverage report.  
> ⚠️ Not supported on Android Automotive OS.

---

## Publishing

'./gradlew generatePomFileForReleasePublication'
> Generates the POM (Project Object Model) file for the release publication, including metadata and dependencies for publishing to a Maven repository.

'./gradlew publishCoreReleasePublicationToMavenLocal'
> Publishes the core library release artifact to the local Maven repository ('~/.m2/repository'), allowing use as a dependency in other local projects.

'./gradlew publishCoreDebugPublicationToMavenLocal'
> Publishes the core library debug artifact to the local Maven repository ('~/.m2/repository').

---

## Documentation

'./gradlew dokkaGenerate'
> Generates Kotlin documentation using Dokka and outputs it to 'docs/${project-version}'.

---

## Notes

- Always run 'clean' before a full build to avoid cache-related inconsistencies.
